# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)
Data starting and ending date 2010-2014
Here I am Finding EDA From the given dataset,
I Analysed Five Important Exploration For Data Analysis that is:
Dimension Exploration,
Date Exploration,
Measure Exploration,
Magnitude Exploration,
Rank Exploration

#	Dimensions Exploration
  Identifying the unique values(or categories) in each dimension. 
  This will help us to understand recognizing how data might be grouped or segmented. 
  which is useful for later analysis. 
  eg: DISTINCT[Dimension], 
  DISTINCT[country],
  DISTINCT[category],
  DISTINCT[product]
## Finding Youngest and Oldest Customers

#	Date Exploration
  Identify the earliest and latest dates(boundries). 
  Understand the scope of he data and the timespan. 
  In order to get earliest and latest date MIN / MAX functions is very useful
  ## Finding Oldest & youngest Customers With Age

# Measure Exploration (Big Numbers)
  Calculate the key matrics of the business(Big Numbers).
  -Highest level of aggregation
  -Lowest level if details
  using  SUM,AVG,COUNT functions
  ## Overall Measure Exploration
